### Description:
Do you know where your voting, and do you know whoâ€™s on the ballot? We understand how much information is out there, and how hard it is to have it be readily available in one place. So we created a resource: A single website that presents the user with useful voting tools, such as:
* Polling location 
* Ballot information
* Voter Registration links

### User Story:
As a first time and/or inexperienced voter, I want a site that gives me all the voting information I need. Such as my polling locations, ballot information, and how to register to vote.
